### Summary: 🗒
I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments I have achieved thus far in my academic and professional journey. Maintaining a 4.0 GPA, completing 120+ credits in 22 months, consistently making the President's List and Honor Roll, and gaining recognition for my academic and professional success, demonstrate my dedication to excellence. My participation in the Raytheon (RTX) 2023 Girls Who Code (GWC) Fall Leadership Academy Software Engineering Internship and being nominated for student employee of the year showcase my commitment to gaining real-world experience and excelling in my field.

Moving forward, I recognize several areas for improvement that will contribute to my continued growth and success. Improving my articulation of ideas and solutions in professional settings, segmenting tasks more effectively, enhancing my software design and engineering skills, and developing better computational thinking skills are key areas of focus. Additionally, finding a balance between work and life, exploring specialties outside of my comfort zone, and learning to step away from a problem to gain a fresh perspective are all essential for my personal and professional development.

As I continue to evolve my career, I am eager to embrace change, broaden my skill set, and make a meaningful impact in the field of Computer Science. I wish to inspire the next generation to take on more interest in STEM fields. As a mother to three daughters, I am particularly looking to inspire and mentor other women who may be hesitant to join the STEM field due to being significantly outnumbered by their male counterparts.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me thus far and look forward to the journey ahead. With a proactive mindset, a passion for learning, and a commitment to excellence, I am confident in my ability to achieve my goals and make a difference in the world of technology.
