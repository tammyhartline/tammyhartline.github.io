### Summary: üóí
I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments I have achieved thus far in my academic and professional journey. Maintaining a 4.0 GPA, completing 135 credits in 22 months, and consistently making the President's List and Honor Roll, and gaining recognition for my academic and professional success, demonstrate my dedication to excellence. My participation in the Raytheon (RTX) 2022 Girls Who Code (GWC) Fall Leadership Academy Software Engineering Internship and being nominated for student employee of the year showcase my commitment to gaining real-world experience and excelling in my field.

Moving forward, I recognize several areas for improvement that will contribute to my continued growth and success. Improving my articulation of ideas and solutions in professional settings, segmenting tasks more effectively, enhancing my software design and engineering skills, and developing better computational thinking skills are key areas of focus. Additionally, finding a balance between work and life, exploring specialties outside of my comfort zone, and learning to step away from a problem to gain a fresh perspective are all essential for my personal and professional development.

As I continue to evolve in my career, I am excited to further explore my passion for artificial intelligence, the creativity and freedom software engineering offers, data analytics, and leadership. My expertise in these areas, coupled with my drive for continuous learning and improvement, will guide me toward new opportunities and challenges. I am eager to embrace change, broaden my skill set, and make a meaningful impact in the field of Computer Science, hopefully inspiring the next generation to take more interest in STEAM, particularly bringing this field to the attention of females, who are severely outnumbered by their male counterparts in this profession.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me thus far and look forward to the journey ahead. With a proactive mindset, a passion for learning, and a commitment to excellence, I am confident in my ability to achieve my goals and make a difference in the world of technology.
