### Introduction/About Me

  My journey into the field of computer science began with a fascination for technology that sparked when the internet was launched to the public. Although computers at that time lacked the advanced features and user-friendliness available today, the potential for growth and innovation captivated me. During my freshman year of college in 2005, I enrolled in a few computer science courses, only to find myself as the sole female student, facing discouragement from pursuing this field. Consequently, I chose to pursue a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting.
<br/>
<br/>
  After college, my fondest moments at work were when our systems encountered issues, allowing me to explore the command prompt and restore the network to full operation. Following a diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy, I shifted my focus to being a stay-at-home mother to my three daughters and working seasonally as a tax specialist. Little did I know that the COVID-19 pandemic would reignite my passion for technology.
<br/>
<br/>
  Confined at home during the pandemic, I became interested in remote work opportunities and was hired as a QuickBooks Payroll software support agent. Within three months, my coworkers encouraged me to explore roles in engineering or development, recognizing my aptitude for technology.
<br/>
<br/>
  Over the next six months, I immersed myself in researching technical careers, taking free courses, and utilizing open-source resources from institutions like MIT and Harvard to expand my knowledge. In May 2022, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in the computer science program at SNHU, simultaneously starting as a student worker in the analytics department.
<br/>
<br/>
  For nearly two years, I balanced my studies with remote work at SNHU, only resigning in November 2023 after accepting an offer as a project lead at Scale AI. During my academic journey, my concentration shifted from STEM Project Management to Software Engineering and finally to Data Analysis, reflecting the breadth of specializations available within computer science.
<br/>
<br/>
  Throughout this experience, I have cultivated a profound love for learning. I constantly seek to expand my knowledge, never feeling proficient enough or bored with mastering a specific skill. This insatiable curiosity has led me to learn and code in a diverse array of languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, M+, DAX, SQL, NoSQL, Java, Python, JavaScript, Spring Boot, JUnit, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, C#, XML, MATLAB, Kotlin, Flutter, Dart, Android Studio, .NET, Bash, GraphQL, Salesforce, Power BI, Tableau, Sharepoint, GIT, and TypeScript.
<br/>
<br/>
  While I may not be an expert in any single language, I am proficient in nearly all of them. My skills encompass manually creating 3D and 4D images, developing dynamic and interactive web or mobile applications, building websites, performing data analysis, creating interactive analytic dashboards, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
  As I reflect on my journey, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities that have allowed me to explore and cultivate my passion for computer science. The enhancements I have proposed for my ePortfolio will showcase my proficiency in software engineering, algorithm design, database optimization, web development, version control, and deployment processes. These skills align seamlessly with my career aspirations of being able to adapt to any technological role I am offered and contribute to the specialization of AI and Data Analysis in the field of computer science.

### My Journey Thus Far

During my nearly two-year tenure as a Data Reporting Coordinator at SNHU, I assumed multiple roles, including Data Warehouse Mapping SME, Report Developer, System Stored Procedure Developer, Project and Process Owner, Dashboard Developer, Agile User Story Creator, Manager, and Owner, and a Project Manager. While I enjoyed each role, I found that project management, which was my original concentration, was not my favorite. This realization led me to change my concentration early on in the computer science program. However, fast forward to the present, and although my current title is not that of a Project Manager, the role responsibilities align closely with those of a PM.

I now work for Scale AI, where I began as a freelance LLM trainer for their sister company, Remotasks. Within a month, I had impressed several team leads and an STO, who recommended me for a new position as a Platinum Team Lead. This contributor-focused role required engagement, attention to detail, and consistent adaptability. I started this role on November 22, 2023, and simultaneously submitted my two weeks' notice to SNHU, working in both roles until my notice period was complete. During this time, I also completed my final week in the Girls Who Code (GWC) internship, presenting my project to RTX (our hosts and mentors) on December 10th, 2023. _(Click here [GWC Hosted by Raytheon Technologies (RTX) Software Engineering Leadership Give Back Project Proposal](/internship_project.md))_

On February 22, 2024, I was promoted to my current role as the Platinum Team Lead Coordinator for the code project teams. Although this role has a different title, it essentially encompasses the responsibilities of a project manager. Through my commitment, integrity, innovative thinking, and excellent problem-solving skills, I have quickly earned the trust and respect of my peers, team members, and leadership. This experience has led me to realize that I thrive in project management roles when they are related to technical projects and product deliveries. I believe my previous reservations about the role stemmed from not being fully familiar with the project I was managing, which focused on sustainability. While I recognize the importance of sustainability, it is not where my true passion lies.

Looking ahead, my ultimate career goal is to transition into the role of a Machine Learning Architect. I am fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize industries and solve complex problems. As a Machine Learning Architect, I aspire to design and develop cutting-edge AI solutions, lead cross-functional teams, and drive innovation in the field. I am actively pursuing opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in machine learning, and I am excited about the prospect of combining my technical expertise, project management experience, and passion for AI to make a significant impact in this domain.
